*get display box off border... or just remove the chart border?

INP resize text - all the smaller text seems too small
    when I make the months text bigger it get cut off but can't seem to figure out how to make the
    chart wider to fit it. 

make responsive?

restructure js files

fix positioning of tooltip

tipLegend - 'year - month' 'Global avg surface temp' 'Variance from base temp of 8.66C'

set ids/classes in js then do all styling in css

*resize window issue - when I resize the window then scroll to see the rest of the chart, the 
    container cuts off the chart and you can't see it, with also a white background starting 
    at the cut.
    FIX - the height/width alone as 100% or 100vw/100vh will size the container off the resized
        window, since it's smaller, the container is smaller too and can't fit the chart so it 
        gets cut off and the background is white becuase you're scrolling outside the container 
        and seeing the body. +Could add a backup bg color to the body.  
        
vertical resize issue - will cut off top for some reason even with min-height: fit-content
