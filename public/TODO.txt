*get display box off border... or just remove the chart border?

INP resize text - all the smaller text seems too small
    when I make the months text bigger it get cut off but can't seem to figure out how to make the
    chart wider to fit it. 

make responsive?

restructure js files

fix positioning of tooltip

tipLegend - 'year - month' 'Global avg surface temp' 'Variance from base temp of 8.66C'

set ids/classes in js then do all styling in css
